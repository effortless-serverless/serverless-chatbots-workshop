# Dialogflow account setup

[Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com) (former API.ai) is a natural language processing engine, owned by Google, that incorporates conversation context like dialogue history, location and user preferences. We'll use it to give NLP powers to our Spaceman bot.

To setup Dialogflow you'll need to do following:

1. Create Dialogflow account
2. Create an agent
3. Get an API key
4. Enabke Small Talk

Each of the steps is described in details below. In case you have everything set up, scroll to the bottom of this page and click on the Next button.
