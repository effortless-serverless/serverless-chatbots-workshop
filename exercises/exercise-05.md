# How to guide your customers: creating a menu

Alright! Time to add meaningful conversations to your chatbot. Up until now, you've created a small and talkative chatbot but every chatbot needs to have its purpose.

The purpose of your Starman chatbot is to:
- Show NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
- Display photos from NASA Mars rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit)
- Show the current position of the International Space Station
- Display how many people are in the space right now
- Show upcoming SpaceX launches

Your task is now is to organize this information so that you display each of the information details when the user asks for it. The best way to do it is in the form of menus. This means you will have to implement a starting menu with a listing of the content user can get from your chatbot. Also in the case of photos from NASA's Mars rovers, you will have an additional submenu, because each of the rovers have different sets of photos. That will cause you to have an another submenu.
