# Simple, built-in FB NLP integration

The third. Seems quick. Well, now the fun starts.

In this exercise, your chatbot will start talking and replying to basic greetings. Like a baby! But a polite one.

Your chatbot should be always prepared to answer to basic greetings, "bye"s and "thank you" messages.
Thiss exercise's task is to make your chatbot reply to these messages. To do so, you will need to enable Natural Language Processing. This does seem difficult, especially if you've never done it before. 

Luckily, Facebook has a developed a lightweight NLP tool to ease and help out with your chatbot development. This tool is actually built-in within Facebook and you can use it already. Read about it on the Facebook documentation and enable it for your chatbot!
