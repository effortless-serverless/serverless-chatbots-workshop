# Reading your chatbot logs?

Second exercise! Good job!

In this exercise you should create and read logs from your chatbot. Knowing how to log is useful, in case you make some mistakes long the way.

In your chatbot, set `console.log` as your `log` function. Then on the beginning of your chatbot, invoke it and pass some log message, such as "Logging from Starman bot!".

Then open your browser and go to AWS web console. There open up your AWS CloudWatch service and find your chatbot Lambda logs.
