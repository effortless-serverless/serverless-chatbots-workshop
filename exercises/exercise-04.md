# Let's chat: small talk integrations

Great, it's time for the fourth!

In this exercise, you task will integrate Dialogflow, a complete NLP library to your chatbot. 

In the previous exercise, you've easily made your first basic NLP integration. Yes, your chatbot can say goodbyes and and greet your customers, but this might not be enough. Your chatbot should be able to do some small talk as well. That will impress your users, increase their interaction with your chatbot and they will share it with their friends too.

To see how to add Dialogflow to your chatbot and see how it works, visit the [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/getting-started/basics).
