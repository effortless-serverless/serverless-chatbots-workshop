# Make it more human-like: add typing

So in the previous exercise you've made your chatbot work and provide space photos and give launch information when asked by your customers. Woot!! But as you've probably noticed, sometimes there are delays when it's getting the content from NASA's or SpaceX's API. You're not sure if your chatbot died and it can be frustrating to your users as they won't know if it's going to respond or not.

Wouldn't it be great if your chatbot could show the "Typing" Facebook indicator when it's getting content, so that you and your users would know that your chatbot is working on it?

These "Typing" indicators called Sender Actions.

**Your task** is to add this "Typing" Sender Action to your chatbot whenever it's getting it's photos or any kind of third party content.
