# Where is the International Space Station

Great work getting so far in the workshop!

Now it's time to learn how to show different types of content, such as the location of the International Space Station.

**Your final task** is to show to your users the current position of the International Space Station on the map. You should have the "See the Internal Space Station position" as a menu option on the starting menu too.


If you've finished this, congratulations! You're awesome! 

You have learned quite a lot about building chatbots! 

You should ping one of the organizers to get some more exercises.
